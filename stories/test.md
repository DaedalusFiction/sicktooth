Oskar Janusson grew up a curious and well-entertained youth, the only child of two ambitious and far-connected socialites who provided for their young avatar every necessary and unnecessary thing. After he graduated with honors from St. Vincent’s, he naturally and immediately began his professorship there, where he enjoyed the sycophantic fruits of a profession foreordained, and was forever immune to any kind of usurper. He married his childhood sweetheart, the only girl or woman the eyes of his virility sought, with whom he enjoyed many a play-date throughout their childhood, pretending games of doctor and patient, cowboy and Indian, or policeman and burglar. Though she matured into a stunningly lithe and dignified woman, she never lost her youthful mischievousness, her enchanting, small-eyed smile, which was never without the shadow of a giggle behind it, which carried her through so many a held door or to the front of nearly every bank-line she had ever encountered. Her name was Ingrid Carlson.

Now Carlson was also an only child, but, unlike Janusson, whose parents denied him the comforts and frustrations of a sibling only because they couldn’t see the use in having another vessel to which they could bequeath their wealth of reputation, not to mention just how much work the first one had been already, Emma was born with a rare disease of immunodeficiency, the precautions of which so absorbed her parents’ time and energy that they had simply nothing left to give. Her doctors unanimously agreed that she was fortunate to have survived her birth, and that whatever time she enjoyed on earth was no right but a gift. 

Janusson and Carlson married young, as all true lovers do, and quickly set to making the most of every moment they had left together. They traveled the globe, in accordance with Emma’s dreams, and though her apparatuses and medications were cumbersome and expensive, their determination prevailed, and before Emma became too weak to lift her eyelids she had seen the fogged alleys of London, the deft gondoliers of Venice, the blinding beaches of Sydney and Rio, and the sprawling, vibrant markets of Bogota and Prague. They built a fortress of memories and ensconced themselves within it, and though Janusson believed that their workmanship would survive any tempest or army’s besiegement, his worries and fears never quite let him be.

One day, as Janusson, enthroned at his grand oaken desk, flipped distractedly through a pile of his students’ exams, a colleague and lifelong friend of his, Ivan Ingelmann, professor of neurology and immunology, entered his study. He, Ingelmann, wrung his sweating hands together and paced over his friend’s polished floorboards for several silent moments before finally revealing his proposal. He had been developing for some years a procedure he had tentatively termed memro-assimilation. He had been experimenting, he told Janusson, with a menagerie of subjects, getting closer and closer to perfecting a method of seamlessly transferring the memories of one consciousness to another. He began by training one animal, say a mouse, how to navigate a maze, and then, through a lengthy and elaborate surgical process that disturbed Janusson as much as it baffled him, had managed to transfer the memories of the trained animal, and along with them the maze’s solution, into the mind of an untrained subject, with a number of remarkable successes. The donor animals, however, rarely survived the ordeal, or if they did, were left catatonic if not completely brain-dead.

Ingelmann’s progress had plateaued, he said, as the animals, lacking the faculties of spoken language, could not provide answers to the questions that Ingelmann quaked to uncover. He came now to Janusson, not because he required any particular expertise his friend possessed, nor a confident ear to which he could pour out his frustrations, nor even to employ the incisiveness of his educated mind; no—Ingelmann came to Janusson now because Janusson had the one thing that Ingelmann amply possessed and yet also absolutely required desperation. 

The proposal, then, was defined: Ingelmann would finally have his human subjects, and would at last pass through the gates of knowledge into the realm of understanding; and Janusson, teetering on the precipice of ruin, would keep his precious Emma with him always, would keep her memories forever intertwined and inseparable from his own, memories that would last him to his own final bed. Emma, now comatose, would likely not last the winter, and Janusson, confident that her only wish would be to care for him in any way she could, agreed.

The day of the operation was set to coincide with the two-hundredth anniversary of the university. Classes were temporarily suspended, and all faculty would be preoccupied with and distracted by the returning alumni and the accommodations they would inevitably seek. Moreover, the event carried a certain symbolism that was not lost on Janusson and Ingelmann. Just as the creation of the university marked the transformation from one history of thought into another, so Ingelmann’s and Janusson’s endeavor marked the transformation of the traditional pursuits of the preservation of the body and the advancement of the mind, formerly cooperating but separate things, into a thing that was both and yet neither, a synthesis of the two and yet a new, primal thing altogether. 

Ingelmann and Janusson made all the necessary preparations concerning the security of their theater of operation, the procuration of instruments and medicines, and the inconspicuous transportation of the ailing Carlson. Janusson had, as Carlson’s health had deteriorated, taken over the majority of her daily care, such that there were no nurse or caretaker to cast a prying eye. Decorations had gone up all over campus, as old friends and lovers reconnected and reconciled with cheers and secret smiles, and Ingelmann, true to his habits of diligence and thoroughness, kept a small journal into which he recorded daily his thoughts. 

Here begins a selection of his notes, which I have reverently edited to facilitate reading and with a commitment to preserve the spirit of his legacy.

###

29 February 1892 - I stand now upon an epoch of scientific discovery. My colleague and lifelong friend, the honored Dr. Oskar Janusson, and I have undertaken to complete what will undoubtedly be recorded in the annals of scientific history as perfect enlightenment. 

It is unfortunate, though not at all unexpected, that I must seek this enlightenment in the shadows, for it is true that the common mind cannot understand what it is we do, and what they cannot understand they fear, and what they fear they persecute. I feel acutely the sidelong glares of my colleagues, of my family, how they distrust my unexplained disappearances, my vague yet terse speech, my bloodstained regalia, reeking with the stench of formaldehyde. And yet it is for their benefit that I so veil my actions; a prophet is never accepted in his hometown, after all, and should they find me out they might undo and destroy the years of progress I have made, have worked out through tears and sleepless nights, progress that will lead us all into a more beautiful and peaceful future. They were patriots who were once deemed traitors, and I, devil to them now, will one day become saint.

4 March, 8 p.m. - Oskar and his bride have arrived. She is the very image of serenity now, what little life that remains in her unmoving eyes glowing softly like distant planets on a moonless night. She, laid out on my operating table, reminds me of the marble or granite sculptures that adorned the sarcophaguses of old. She is beautiful in a frail way, and I see perfectly how Oskar fell so easily entranced to her so many years ago. 

I had planned to entertain the two at my home not far from the campus, but when they arrived Oskar was insistent that we should begin the procedure without delay, lest in the cold night’s contemplation he should lose his will to act. I write this now as I wait for the tranquilizer to take its effect, as I watch them lay beside one another, the one dripping into the delirium to which the other has already grown so accustomed; I imagine him some Grecian hero travelling to the underworld to rescue his true companion from the river of death. Though I feel now a movement to weep, I must maintain my resolve, as their fate is not in the hero’s hands, but my own.

5 March, 7:30 a.m. - The night was long, but we have come through. The operation, or operations, went as smoothly as might have been hoped. Emma is stable, breathing steadily, and though her nerves seem responsive, the light has gone out of her eyes, and I fear she will not survive much longer. 

Oskar rests. I see beneath his eyelids some kind of rapid eye movement, though not the random, sporadic darting characteristic of one who dreams; there seems a distinct pattern, something like a back and forth, a struggling movement, that reminds me of schoolchildren playing tug-o-war. His breath quickens, slows, and quickens again, sometimes rapidly, sometimes in long arching waves. His temperature has been steadily rising, and in response I have increased his dosage of post-op antibiotics. I have chosen not to allow myself any kind of celebration or self-congratulation until they both are fully recovered.

9 p.m. - Emma has passed. She went quietly, without any noticeable stir. A pang of regret passed through me when I discovered that she had passed, but I remind myself that there must be death before there can be rebirth. Her memory, I only hope, lives on inside Oskar. I have placed her body in one of the preservation chambers generally reserved for bodies donated and awaiting dissection, that upon Oskar’s recovery he might gaze once more upon the corporeality of his great affection before she is returned to the earth.

At one time, around four o’clock, a group of alumni wandered down from the ceremonies above, evidently having been separated from a presumably harried and exhausted student guide. There were five or six of them, the alumni, in their mid-thirties and wearing the sort of wing tips, khaki shorts and summer coats indicative of old money. They trotted up and down the halls outside my little operating room in the mortuary, peeking through door windows and giggling sheepishly in the euphoria of their nostalgia. After a few minutes of horsing around they returned to the surface in search of mint juleps and hors d’oeuvres, except for two, a delirium-eyed blonde with a golden wedding band on her freckled, bony hands, and a short-haired fellow bulging out from his varsity jacket like an overfilled cream puff, his fingers unadorned. They had been flirting with my operating room door, frolicking back and forth before it, and her blouse was nearly to her elbows when the guide, their unwitting judge and my timely savior, descended to inform them that the ceremony would begin presently. 

[Editor’s note: Although the preceding anecdote is of comparatively little importance regarding Janusson’s experience, I have included it in this account as an illustration of the transformation taking place in Ingelmann’s own behavior, and, I hope, as an example of the effects of deceitfulness on the conscience, even one so formidable as a doctor of medicine’s.]

6 March, 2 a.m. - It is quiet again. Oskar awoke once, mumbled a few words, which I could not discern, and fell back into unconsciousness. What he experiences now in that twice-inhabited brain of his I cannot fathom; perhaps some secretary of his senses scrambles to organize the sudden and massive deposit of files, and in her confusion neglects or forgets to answer the knocked door. Or it may be that, to escape the trauma of the procedure, Oskar has receded into some safe cellar, exhausted and afraid to face the truth of his new existence. Whatever the case, I pray that he returns, and soon.

7 p.m. - Oskar has awoken! He is eating now, a small plate of cucumber sandwiches and Gruyere, leftovers that I managed to scavenge from the war-torn kitchen of the university commons. He remains in a haze, having only opened his eyes merely an hour ago. I congratulated him on our shared victory, to which he smiled sluggishly. 

As soon as he regained sufficient lucidity he inquired to the wellbeing of his beloved. I admit that I told him only that she was secured in a safe place, for at the time I feared for his still fragile mind. To reveal at once her expiration might prove detrimental, to his health and my cause.

We spoke casually on the subject of the operation, but as I recounted the events of the evening, his placid mood quickly began to transform: with increasing frequency he would search the room at perceived movements or agents, as his speech became more slurred and his words nonsensical. He would sometimes confuse his pronouns or let out a chortle or guffaw when neither of us had said anything at all. His left hand, I noticed, he would drag along his neckline, opening and closing his fingers as if grasping for some phantom collar. I made some comment to the excitement and stress he must be experiencing and applied another injection of morphine to calm his nerves. 

9 March - We have done it! Her memories are his! He sees them perfectly, he says, clear as the glassy lake beside which she, Emma, sat with her old mother and told her that she was to be wed; the very lake that Oskar told me he had never visited, not once, and yet in his mind looks and smells as familiar as any of his childhood hiding places. Smells! Simply amazing. 

[Editor’s note: The lake mentioned here is likely Walchensee, in the municipality of Kochen, Germany. Emma’s parents, Walter and Inge Carson, owned a small summer cottage there. The name Walchensee is a derivative of the German "Walchen," meaning "stranger."]

My own mind surges with so many new and imperative questions: How much of Emma’s memory has Oskar absorbed? What of her hopes, her worries, her fears? Will they fade over time? How quickly? Can Oskar differentiate between them and his own? Is that dichotomy now irrelevant? And what new insights can be gained into the nature of consciousness, personhood, conscience, and the soul? Oh, that I were not only a neurologist but a philosopher, a psychologist, a priest, and a poet! 

This evening I revealed to Oskar the truth of his beloved, to which he very quickly forgave me and asked to see the body. After a curiously short, silent moment he nodded and left the room. Something struck me as odd in the way that he nodded; it was not as though he had come to some personal decision, but it seemed rather he nodded in acknowledgment, as a cadet who accepts orders from an officer, unquestioningly and impersonally. I have decided, though it pains me immeasurably, to refrain from my prepared questionnaires until he has fully recovered, at least physically.

10 March - Oskar has returned to his daily activities. His rehabilitation has been much smoother than either of us anticipated. In many ways he is the same old Oskar I know; he is the same witty, honest, hardworking, jovial man with whom I spent so many a long night in deep conversation, and yet, somehow, he seems in some ways a stranger to me. He is more formal, less familiar, and less talkative than how I remember him. 

We spoke this afternoon over tea on some subject that caught our mutual interest: a local barber has been accused of theft, a considerable though not particularly newsworthy amount. When I mentioned that, according to his bewildered wife of seventeen years, he had fled to some small coastal village in the south of Greece, the polite smile that Oskar had been wearing vanished at once, and I saw before me that shivering, frightened child that lay recovering on my gurney only a few nights before. An instant later, as though some electrical switch had been turned in his brain, he was back to his genial self, but the image of his terrified visage has remained before me in my mind’s eye all day.

11 March - A knock came upon my door this morning. Not having yet made my toilet for the day, and yet not wanting to keep any visitor waiting, I hastened to dress myself as well as I could. The knock came again, quickly and this time more forcefully. As I bounded down the stairs I shouted that I would arrive momentarily, and yet, as I opened the door, there was no one to be seen. The interim, I am sure, between the final knock and my answering was entirely too short for any young prankster to have run off; I shut the door and returned to my morning preparations.

Not even an hour later another knock came upon my door, this one just as unmistakable as the last. At the time I was seated in my little reading cove in the foyer, leafing through a collection of Ovid’s poetry that Janusson had given me several years prior. I leapt to the door and threw it open, yet again - nothing! This time, convinced of some mischief, or worse, I seized my cane and made a thorough patrol of the grounds, but not a leaf or blade of grass seemed out of place. 

Upon my return I found my front door to be shut tight, and there in the wood spotted a most peculiar thing. There appeared to be a sort of scratch marks, or claw marks, in patterns of four and spaced like human fingers, though how one could have cut so deeply into the hard pine of the door I cannot say. Even stranger, the marks appeared aged, not fresh - and the fact that I had not noticed them prior I find quite unnerving and disconcerting. 

In the zealotry of my youth such events as happened today might have driven me wild with curiosity, and yet, as I recline here at my desk and make these notes, I reflect that some of that vigor has gone out of me. Experience, it seems, has blunted my lust for knowledge. For so many years I was resolved that not only were there answers to every conceivable question, but that through human enterprise any of them could and would be revealed. Now, after so many phenomena observed, both of the natural world and not, and each of them carrying with them so many paradoxes that time has necessarily concealed, I wonder that there are things that will never be known, and are perhaps not meant to be.  

[Editor’s note: The following entry, as the one preceding it, is marked 10 March. However, the events listed here, based on my research, appear to have taken place on the twelfth, not the tenth. Most likely Ingelmann, in his haste to record the following, simply forgot what day it was.]

10 March - I visited Oskar’s office this morning to invite him to brunch and perhaps plan out a time for the more thorough interview I had been rehearsing in my mind these past weeks. When I arrived, a colleague of his in the literature department informed me that he had not come in that morning, nor had he been present for any of his lectures the night before, nor had he left any notification of absence.

Curious, I made my way down to the mortuary, to the humble operating room where we had conducted Oskar’s metamorphic rite, but I found no evidence of his presence there. Growing more concerned, I began to search the campus, all of his favorite reading spots, in the library and at his home, but nowhere could I locate my friend. I struggled to remind myself that it was entirely likely that he had taken a spontaneous holiday, and indeed nobody at the university would chastise him for this dereliction of his teaching duties, particularly given the trials he had been facing regarding his ailing wife, though her death was to all but Oskar and I still unknown. Surely he would show up again with time, and indeed his privacy I must respect.

On a whim I decided on a brief respite myself, and I considered a stroll through town would do nicely. On my way to the market a sudden and powerful rain came on, and I was forced to seek refuge beneath the canopy an oak, a great local fixture that over its reported two-hundred years of existence has garnered something of a personality and mythology its own (the latter of which I will not go into now). 

As I waited for the downpour to abate, or at least allay, I noticed a dark figure kneeling by a gravestone in a nearby cemetery. Why a person should choose such a time as that, in the throes of nature’s raging, to pay respects to the dead astounded me. I watched the figure for some time, and after some scrutiny a thought came to me. During a lull in the rain I crossed the street to take a closer look at the mourner, and to my amazement it turned out to be my dear Oskar! Without a thought to my own safety I bounded over the cemetery’s pointed iron fence and up the mud-slicked hill to my troubled partner’s side.

There he knelt, hunchbacked, rocking steadily back and forth over a grave marked Walter Carson: Emma’s late father. He wept with abandon, his tears tributaries to the streams of rainwater that flowed over his clenched eyes. Tentatively I placed a hand on his drooped shoulder, and it was then that I noticed his own hands; he held a teaspoon in his left and was methodically working the edge of it into the flesh of his right, such that the bowl of the spoon was completely inside the flap of his raw, pruned palm. I recoiled at once at this gruesome sight, but quickly my professional instincts took over, and I hailed a carriage that passed below. I explained to the driver my predicament, and he, generous and decent soul that he was, took us at once to the university. 

I thanked the driver and carried my friend to my little operating room, where I tended his wound and applied to him yet more morphine. Fearing another episode of self-destruction, I fastened his arms and legs to the metal rails of his gurney. He is sleeping now, quietly wandering the illusions of his crumbling mind. 

13 March - Oskar slept fitfully through the night. He awoke late this morning, and after some tender words, which I hoped would soothe him and perhaps open him to the possibility of a more detailed discussion, I, with his permission, set up my phonograph recorder. What follows is our conversation, presented in its entirety, unedited save for punctuation and a few notes of my own:

[Editor’s note: I have taken the liberty of reformatting the following conversation to a more contemporary style.]

"How are you feeling, old friend?"

Oskar lay motionless, his expression blank save for a near imperceptible twitching in his brow. 

"Tell me what is on your mind," I said.

"What makes a man?" he said at length.

"I’m sorry?"

"Why is a man a man and not an animal, or a rock, or a thought?"

"I’m not sure I follow you."

He turned and looked me straight in the eye, so intensely that a feeling of strange shame forced me to look away. "It’s the memories, Ivan," he said. "We are what we remember, what we choose to remember."

"Certainly there is more to it than that, yes? Surely a man is not simply the sum of his experiences. There must be something more, some soul or spirit that guides him."

He laid his head back on his pillow and closed his eyes, and let out an exhausted sigh. "I thought so too, Ivan. I really did."

"Let me ask you this, then. Who do you say that you are?"

"I was wrong about her, Ivan. We were wrong."

I furrowed my brow. "About Emma, you mean? How so?"

"She is weak still, but not for long. She hunts me in the night. I can feel it growing inside me, spreading out like a cancer, through my chest, into my lungs, my stomach, my neck. I feel it, feel her...her..."

"Her what?"

He paused. "Madness," he whispered.

"Oskar, listen to me," I said, leaning in and placing a comforting hand on his arm, to which he recoiled as an abused dog flinches from the hand of a cruel master. He turned to me sharply, his lips outturned and peeled back over his grinding teeth.

"You couldn’t leave it alone," he seethed. "You, you demon! You couldn’t leave it alone!"

"Oskar," I said.

He pressed his eyelids together, so tightly that I feared he might pull at the stitching that circumscribed his hairline. "Put that down! You put that down right now!" He thrashed against his bonds, his jaw clenched and the sinews of his neck taut. He let out some otherworldly sound, some synthesis of a siren’s wail and a banshee’s scream. 

"Oskar, what’s wrong?"

His eyes opened wide and frantically searched the room. "Scotland scratching, scratching! and the robber-barons press their luck, lose their touch!"

"Talk to me, Oskar! What’s wrong? How can I help you?"

He collapsed, turned his neck and buried his face into his pillow as best as his restraints would allow. "Morphine," he mumbled.

I doubled his dosage, and soon he would be gone.

[Editor’s note: the following entry was found later, in 1951, beneath the floorboards of a small weaver’s cottage outside Kochen, Germany, not far from the aforementioned lake. I have examined this entry’s handwriting and compared it to previous notes, and though there are a number of discrepancies, particularly with regard to the size and shape of some capital letters, I believe the following to be authentic.]

24 March - This shall be my final entry. It has been nearly two weeks since my conversation with Oskar, which was the last I had spoken with him, and possibly the last he had spoken with any human soul. 

When I awoke the following morning, I peered into his sleeping place and found naught of him but frayed gauze. His restraints seemed partly chewed, partly stretched and snapped through sheer force. Not only was my dear Oskar missing, but he had evidently taken the corpse of his Emma with him.

A thorough search was organized through the local sheriff’s office, and a heartening number of students, faculty and townsfolk gathered to seek out the lost soul; to their infinite credit they left no cobblestone unturned or water well unexcavated, scouring diligently through the night until the tender mists of dawn crept in, and those not employed in any official capacity to the search, or with vested personal interest in the whereabouts of the professor, returned to their respective stations. In the days following the search, a more detailed investigation was instigated, and I, being Oskar’s oldest companion and the last to see him alive, was called in for questioning. 

In the months leading up to Oskar’s ordeal I had managed to avoid the scrutiny of my colleagues, who were not motivated to discover in my behavior any unlawful or unethical thing; but here, after so many unrelenting barrages of inquiry and accusation (which began so softly and amicably), I’m afraid that, in my weariness and guilt, I surrendered the truth of Oskar’s experiences. Were I some international agent of espionage, I consider, perhaps I might have kept secret our work; but I am in my heart a man of science, allied only to the pursuit of truth, and any form of deception, I’m afraid, I cannot maintain.

They have seized all of my papers, my instruments, my journals, and personal effects. I write these words from behind the immovable pillars of my imprisonment; and yet, though they indeed represent the inevitable bonds of justice, I feel an undeniable calm washed over me, the promise fulfilled of an end to the burdens of responsibility, as a young sentry feels when relieved of duty at the end of a long and lonely night-watch. 

The days grow longer as I await trial, and as I sit and gaze through my little barred window at the bustling, churning valley-town below, and at the sprawling, sapphire mountains beyond, I cannot but wonder at the whereabouts of my dear Oskar. You must know, wherever you are, old friend, that my failure was one of mere ambition, the same ambition that raises so many a scientific mind to sainthood, yet in me has created a martyr. 

I must keep my words short; the claps of the guard’s soles upon the cement floor ring out as church bells, echoing through these halls as to the honor of an honest man’s death, or rather his life.

Forgive me!

###

There ends the journal of professor Ivan Ingelmann. In June of 1893, after a long and involved court case, he was found guilty of criminal malpractice, among a host of other charges, and sentenced to Hamburg Prison, where he remained until his death in 1945. 

Oskar Janusson was never found. Almost three months after the events of March, 1892, the body of Emma Janusson resurfaced, bloated and decomposing, strewn out on the front steps leading up to the university’s main lecture hall. Her body was well-kept, as well as could be preserved without proper refrigeration, except that her skull had been shaved and split in half longitudinally, crudely yet carefully done as though with hammer and chisel, and the left hemisphere of her brain removed. Her body was given a proper burial, in a plot beside her father’s, where she rests to this day.
